We introduce the Deep Symbolic Network (DSN) model,
which aims at becoming the white-box version of Deep Neural Networks
(DNN). The DSN model provides a simple, universal yet powerful
structure, similar to DNN, to represent any knowledge of the world,
which is transparent to humans. The conjecture behind the DSN model
is that any type of real world objects sharing enough common
features are mapped into human brains as a symbol. Those symbols are
connected by links, representing the composition, correlation,
causality, or other relationships between them, forming a deep,
hierarchical symbolic network structure. Powered by such a
structure, the DSN model is expected to learn like humans, because
of its unique characteristics. 
    
First, it is universal, using the same structure to store any knowledge. 
    
Second, it can learn symbols from the world and construct the deep symbolic networks automatically, by utilizing the fact that real world objects have been naturally separated by singularities.  
    
Third, it is symbolic, with the capacity of performing causal deduction and generalization.
    
Fourth, the symbols and the links between them are transparent to us, and thus we will know what it has learned or not - which is the key for the security of an AI system. 
    
Fifth, its transparency enables it to learn with relatively small data. Sixth, its knowledge can be accumulated. 
    
Last but not least, it is more friendly to unsupervised learning than DNN. We present the details of the model, the algorithm powering its automatic learning ability, and describe its usefulness in different use cases. The purpose of this paper is to generate broad interest to develop it within an open source project centered on the Deep Symbolic Network (DSN) model towards the development of general AI.
